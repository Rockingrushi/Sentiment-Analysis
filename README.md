## 📌 Sentiment Analysis Web Application

This project is a web-based Sentiment Analysis application built using Python, Flask, and Machine Learning techniques. The application allows users to enter text such as reviews, comments, or feedback and predicts the sentiment as Positive, Negative, or Neutral along with a confidence score.

The machine learning model is trained using real-world datasets and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as text cleaning and vectorization. The trained model is integrated with a Flask backend and presented through a modern, responsive web interface using HTML and CSS with glassmorphism design.
